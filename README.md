### Mission & Vision

### What we have done
##### [NumSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/NumSharp)
High Performance Computation for Tensor in .NET, keep APIs same as NumPy and SciPy.
##### [TensorFlow.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET)
.NET Standard bindings for Google's TensorFlow for developing, training and deploying Machine Learning models in C#.
##### [SiaNet](https://github.com/SciSharp/SiaNet)
A C# deep learning library, human friendly, CUDA/OpenCL supported, well structured, easy to extend.
##### [BotSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/BotSharp)
The Open Source AI Chatbot Platform Builder in 100% C# Running in .NET Core with Machine Learning algorithm.
##### [Torch.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Torch.NET)
C#/NETStandard bindings for PyTorch. Run your Tensor computations or Neural Networks on the GPU.
##### [Keras.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Keras.NET)
Keras.NET is a high-level neural networks API, written in C# with Python Binding and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. 
##### [Numpy.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/Numpy.NET)
C# bindings for NumPy - a fundamental library for scientific computing, machine learning and AI
##### [ICSharpCore](https://github.com/SciSharp/ICSharpCore)
Jupyter kernel in C# .NET Core which is the standard interface for SciSharp STACK.
